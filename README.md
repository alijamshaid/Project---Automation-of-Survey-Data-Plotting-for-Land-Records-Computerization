# Project---Automation-of-Survey-Data-Plotting-for-Land-Records-Computerization

Goal of this project is to automate the plotting survey data as many GIS professionals plot this data using manual process which is time consuming and highly prone 
to errors.
This Project focuses on Automating plotting survey data process using Arcpy in Python. Surveyors measure the parcels in the field using DGPS in the form of Latitude, 
Longitude, Elevation, Parcel Number. This project plot that data, measure area and storing it into attribute table using Python.

Accuracy of this project is mainly dependent upon the surveyors points, however the automation process will be further enhanced to improve the accuarcy and reduce
manual plotting efforts.

--------------------------------------

This Project having one python script which uses mainly uses arcpy and other libraries to
implement the automation of plotting, and mapping  of survey data.
